\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Statement}

{The massive move to densely populated areas during the 20th century has a bipolar effect on cities and their planning mechanisms: On the one hand, urbanization brings clear economic benefits, reduction of poverty, agglomeration of knowledge and innovation, improved public health, and sustainable energy consumption \cite{Glaeser2011, reckien2017climate, banerjee2011companion}. On the other hand, massive urban migration, entangled with climate change, technological disruptions, and inequality, can become unsustainable for traditional urban mechanisms \cite{parnell2016defining, reckien2017climate}. With over 50\% of the world population living today in urban areas, and projected two-thirds by 2050, city-planning practitioners face unprecedented planning challenges \cite{united2018world, UnitedNationsHabitatIII2017}.} 

{Amidst these growing challenges, legacy planning and decision-making processes are rendered insufficient \cite{Ben-Joseph2004, green2019smart, gaffney2018smarter}. Slow moving planning processes lag behind population growth; monolithic regulations struggle with technological disruptions; scarcity of data and evidence-based processes stifle urban decision-making \cite{world2016inspiring, grauman1976orders, chen2014global}. These issues can also encourage development patterns that neglect proper scrutiny, `cut corners', and fail to provide the basic needs of well-preforming cities \cite{banerjee2011companion}. Under these circumstances, urban decision-makers are forced to reactivally respond rather than pre-plan.}

{During the past two decades, the tech industry recognized these challenges, and sought to replace legacy urban processes with rapid, scalable, data driven and evidence based solutions \cite{soderstrom2014smart}. Under the title of `Smart Cities', these efforts sought to optimize urban environments using strategies, technologies and methods imported from the Silicon-Valley. Yet after over a decade of real-world experiments, most `Smart Cities' use-cases failed to offer comprehensive solutions and instead were materialized through sporadic optimizations to legacy systems. \cite{green2019smart, gaffney2018smarter}. Even if successful in some domain, these solutions often overlook the complexity of cities and the ever-changing needs of their inhabitants \cite{gaffney2018smarter}. In addition, many Smart Cities solutions surfaced new concerns in the context of technology and cities, such as bias, inequality, privacy, and misuse \cite{green2019smart}.} 

{In this respect, an ever-growing urban world is now facing a planning dilemma: both traditional urban processes, as well as new `smart' solutions cannot efficiently respond to the emerging challenges of 21st century cities \cite{soderstrom2014smart}.}

\subsection{Proposed Contribution}

{In this dissertation I propose an alternative human-centric, urban planning and decision-making process. I examine this emerging process through the design, development and real-world deployment of \textbf{CityScope}: an urban modeling, simulation and decision-making platform, that meets urban technology with social discourse. CityScope proposes a set of comprehensive, community-driven, adaptable, and iterative technologies, that confront planning questions from the point of view of citizens \cite{batty2013new, habitat2016new}. In the UN-Habitat III (2016), the need for a new human-centric, planning technology was recognized and manifested at the `New Urban Agenda': {\textit{``The New Urban Agenda presents a paradigm shift based on the science of cities; it lays out standards and principles for the planning, construction, development, management, and improvement of urban areas (...) We will foster the creation (...) of open, user-friendly and participatory data platforms using technological and social tools available to transfer and share knowledge (...) to enhance effective urban planning and management.''}} \cite{habitat2016new}.This thesis extends on four major themes of CityScope development and deployments: (i) insight, (ii) prediction, (iii) transformation, and (vi) consensus:}

{\textbf{Insight and Prediction:} New spatial analytics and urban-modeling techniques, novel data resources as well as new processing methodologies, can augment participatory planning with real-time insights and predictions \cite{salganik_bit_2017, Kitchin2014, Ben-Joseph2001}. Data-driven methods (such as Machine-Learning and Deep-Learning models) can expedite the investigation of complex planning scenarios and their effects on human dynamics, traffic, energy-use, or economic performance \cite{Foth2011, Song2010}. This dissertation explores new ways to collect, analyze, model, and communicate urban insights and predictions.} 

{\textbf{Transformations:} Urban-design, scenario testing, and spatial intervention through iterative exploration. Interactive technologies, including Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality, Computer-Vision, web-based applications and even robotics can support iterative participation processes. These technologies allow users to explore, dynamically change and create numerous planning scenarios side-by-side, in both physical and virtual environments. Design iterations could simultaneously be evaluated for their trade-offs and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), in an ``apples-to-apples'' comparison \cite{Ishii2002}. This kind of synchronous design process does not only lower cost and expedite the search for solutions, but can also expose unpredictable designs.}

{\textbf{Consensus and Collaborative Governance:} Constructing consensus-driven decision-making processes. The ability to engage multiple stakeholders simultaneously is a fundamental aspect in a new urban process \cite{Ben-Joseph2004}. Unlike traditional systems, these tools are designed around large-scale, shared public spaces (physical or virtual) that can facilitate multiple participants and conversations at once. This can reduce the bureaucratic overhead of negotiating in different channels, thus prompting concise, result-driven participation sessions \cite{Ben-Joseph2001, Innes2016}.}



{This thesis contributes to urban modeling and simulation, HCI systems, and Decision Support Systems in several aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item The development of a scalable, real-time, socio-technical urban modelling and simulation platform.
	\item A system for distributed urban analytics through decentralized computation system. 
	\item The development of novel analytics modules to asses urban behavior, mobility, and performance. 
	\item Deployment of numerous CityScope platforms around the world, several in real-world city-planning contexts.
	\item The creation of community of users, developers, contributes, and researchers building and using CityScope worldwide.
