The I/O Bulb infrastructure on which the application is based allows physical architectural models placed on an ordinary table surface to cast shadows accurate for arbitrary times of day; to throw reflections off glass facade surfaces; to affect a real-time and visually coincident simulation of pedestrian-level windflow; and so on. We then use comparisons among Urp and several earlier I/O Bulb applications as the basis for an understanding of luminous-tangible interactions, which result whenever an interface distributes meaning and functionality between physical objects and visual information projectively coupled to those objects. Finally, we briefly discuss two issues common to all such systems, offering them as informal thought-tools for the design and analysis of luminous-tangible interfaces.

The contemporary designer is required assimilate these divergent media into a single mental construct and in so doing is distracted from the central process of design. We propose an augmented reality workbench called "Luminous Table" that attempts to address this issue by integrating multiple forms of physical and digital representations. 2D drawings, 3D physical models, and digital simulation are overlaid into a single information space in order to support the urban design process. We describe how the system was used in a graduate design course and discuss how the simultaneous use of physical and digital media allowed for a more holistic design approach.

This poper presents a new generation of TUIs that enable dynamic sculpting and computational analysis using digitally augmented continuous physical materials. These new types of TUI, which we have termed 'Continuous TUIs', offer rapid form giving in combination with computational, feedback. Two experimental systems and their applications in the domain of landscape architecture are discussed here, namely 'Illuminating Clay' and 'SandScape'. Our results suggest that by exploiting the physical properties of continuous soft materials such as clay and sand, it is possible to bridge the division between physical and digital forms and potentially to revolutionise the current design process.},

Specifically, it examines methodological and practical issues raised by the design and use of such systems in long-term policy formulation, with a focus on their!potential!as data collection instruments and analytical platforms for qualitative scenario planning. The research questions addressed herein examine how the use of collective intelligence platforms informs the process of scenario planning in urban public policy. Specifically, how (if at all) does the design and deployment of such platforms influence the number and type of participants involved, people's reasons for participation, the kinds of activities they perform, and the speed and timeline of the scenario creation process? Finally, what methodological considerations does the use of such instruments raise for urban planning research in the future? Two prototypical online platforms were developed to explore these issues. In-depth interviews with experts in the fields of urban planning, public participation, crowdsourcing, and scenarios were conducted, combined with secondary analysis of comparable approaches in other fields. The results were used to create an analytical framework for comparing systems across a common set of measurement constructs. This framework was used to analyze the case studies relative to a base case and three additional comparative examples. The dissertation closes with a reflection on how the use of such online approaches might impact!the role and process of qualitative scenario research in public policy formulation in the future, and what this suggests for subsequent scholarly inquiry.},

Methods: A well-known audit tool was used to evaluate 84 street segments at the urban edge of metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts, using on-site visits and three web-based tools. The assessments were compared to evaluate their relative accuracy and usefulness. Results: Web-based audits, based-on Google Maps, Google Street View, and MS Visual Oblique, tend to strongly agree with on-site audits on land-use and transportation characteristics (e.g., types of buildings, commercial destinations, and streets). However, the two approaches to conducting audits (web versus on-site) tend to agree only weakly on fine-grain, temporal, and qualitative environmental elements. Among the web tools used, auditors rated MS Visual Oblique as the most valuable. Yet Street View tends to be rated as the most useful in measuring fine-grain features, such as levelness and condition of sidewalks. Conclusion: While web-based tools do not offer a perfect substitute for on-site audits, they allow for preliminary audits to be performed accurately from remote locations, potentially saving time and cost and increasing the effectiveness of subsequent on-site visits. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Since the fall of 1998, the US Departmentof Energy has organized fournational meetings on Tools for Community Design and Decision Making (TCDDM). The TCDDM meetings brought together community practitioners working in land use planning and community development; tool providers offering a wide spectrum of visualization, impact analysis, predictive modelling, and collaborative decision making tools; and foundations and public agencies working to advance more effective planning tools and process techniques. In general, TCDDM participants are interested in helping communities make better decisions about land use, resource use, community development and community design. More broadly, they want to help communities become more livable and more environmentally and economically sustainable. To achieve this, TCDDM organizers believe that much of the solution relies upon the successful integration of technical tools for land and resource management and other community development objectives, with process techniques for civic participation, stakeholder involvement and consensus building. Together these elements form what might be referred to as a Planning Support System (PSS) for communities. Over the course of the last three years, TCDDM participants have identified strategies to improve decision support tools, and explored ways to make the use of these tools and process techniques more mainstream. This chapter highlights key outcomes of these meetings, including TCDDM core values, key principles of effective planning support systems, and an overview of many of the tools presented at these meetings. The tools overview considers how various tools support these principles. A more thorough analysis of the opportunities and constraints represented by these tools would be a valuable next step in helping communities better assess which are the best tools for meeting their specific needs.},
