\subsection*{Description}
% 
\textit{``In the history of urban studies and planning, most theory and applications have focused on the long term (...) Of course, many groups are concerned with how cities function more routinely over the day but this has not been considered part of urban planning(...)"}[Batty, 2013]\newline 

How can urban-data and spatial analytics inform a New Urban Process? The \textbf{Technical research area} expands on recent geo-spatial and urban data-science research. It focuses on two themes of the CityScope process, \textbf{insight} and \textbf{prediction}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{insight}: How to collect and analyse urban data to understand current conditions?
    Readings in this subsection will explore Location Based Services and geo-tagged data, remote sensing and tracking, spatial-analysis and data processing.
    \item \textbf{prediction}: Turning urban analytics into predictions. Readings in this subsection will explore the effort to predict the effects of planning and spatial transformations on various urban layers, from transportation and real-estate to inequality and human dynamics.
    It will explore `causality' in the context of urban planning, and the way \textit{what if} scenarios should be constructed, tested and validated.


    
\end{itemize}
Finally, this section will include readings on the limitations and risks of using urban data, from the perspective of privacy and accuracy.
